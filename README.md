## 5A) To find the L and U matrix

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
## Step 1:

import numpy library using import statement.

## Step 2:

From scipy package import lu().

## Step 3:

Get input from user and pass it as an array.

## Step 4: 

Get P,L,U matrix using lu().

## Step 5:

Print L and U matrix.

## Program:

```
/*
'''Program to find L and U matrix using LU decomposition.
Developed by: Dharani.E
RegisterNumber: 21500555
'''

# To print L and U matrix
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import lu
A = np.array(eval(input()))
P, L, U = lu(A)
print(L)
print(U)
*/
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.

## 5B) To find the LU Decomposition of a matrix

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
## Step 1:

import numpy library using import statement.

## Step 2:

From scipy package import lu_factor() and lu_solve().

## Step 3:

Get two inputs from user and pass it as matrix array.

## Step 4: 

Find lu and pivot value of first matrix using lu_factor().

## Step 5:

Find solution of the matrix by using lu_solve() by passing lu,pivot values as first argument and second matrix as second argument.

## Step 6:

Print the solution.

## Program

```
/*'''Program to solve a matrix using LU decomposition.
Developed by: Dharani.E
RegisterNumber: 21500555
'''

# To print X matrix (solution to the equations)
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import lu_factor, lu_solve
A = np.array(eval(input()))
B = np.array(eval(input()))
lu, pivot = lu_factor(A)
x = lu_solve((lu,pivot),B)
print(x)

```


## Output:
